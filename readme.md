## Requirements

- jq (JSON processor)
- curl
- Proofhub account
- Proofhub API key

## Usage

    ```bash
    ./phtimelog.sh
    ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**

    - Select a Proofhub Timesheet.
    - Choose a Todolist.
    - Pick a Task.
    - If the Task has subtasks, select a Subtask.
    - Enter time details when prompted.

3. **Review Results:**

    - The script will display the selected entries and log the time in Proofhub.

## Dependencies

Ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- jq (JSON processor): [jq Installation Guide](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
- curl: [curl Download Page](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)

## Configuration

The script uses a configuration file named `proofhub.json` for storing Proofhub API details. Make sure to configure this file before running the script.

### Example `proofhub.json`:

```json
{
  "API_ENDPOINT": "https://example.proofhub.com/api/v3",
  "USER_AGENT": "your_proofhub_email@example.com",
  "API_KEY": "your_proofhub_api_key"
}
```

Replace the placeholder values with your Proofhub API details.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions in Proofhub to log time.
- Review the script prompts and provide accurate information.
